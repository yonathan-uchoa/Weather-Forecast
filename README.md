##Simple Weather forecast app using Nuxtjs

This app are made just for **practice**, using a weather api given for free by: https://openweathermap.org/

You can make a search using your *city name* and *country acronym*, but if your country have **more than one city with same name** (like some cities in Brasil), you only get **one of them**.

Witch a search you get:
  * Seven days forecast;
  * Weather conditions;
  * Actual temperature;
  * Min./Max. temperature for the day and the other seven days;
  * Alert messages;
